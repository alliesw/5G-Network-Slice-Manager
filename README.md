5G-Network Slice Manager with CLI commands 

Network slicing approaches for offering & delivery 5G networks: 

(1) Standalone private 5G networks:
slicing is used to customize the behavior for different use cases/traffic types and to provide isolation between them.

(2) Virtual private 5G networks:
slicing is used to meet customization and isolation needs per use case/traffic type as well as per enterprise customer. 

(3) Hybrid private 5G networks:
slicing is used to customize and isolate slices per enterprise customer and use case/traffic type. The hybrid approach enables a more flexible distribution of functionality, more efficient use of infrastructure and improved mobility in and out of the customer premises.
