Approaches to building & operating 5G private networks w/ network slicing 

Categorization is based off geographical area: campus-based, wide-area and limited-area

(1) campus-based scenarios: Smart Manufacturing Plant Services 
> Local consumption of services: Use a standalone or hybrid Private 5G network
- Core NFs can be deployed in edge DCs within or tightly integrated with the plant, 
typically together with RAN functions.

(2) wide-area scenarios: Transportation Services 
> Wide area coverage for services: Use a virtual network 
- Set up RAN sclicing across the entire network
- Deploy core NFs in edge DCs strategically throughout the network

(3) Limited-area scenarios: Hotspot for virtual networks for a Sports Arena 
- deploy a throughput-optimized slice for the core virtual network
- deploy slice using RRP in dedicated sites to gaurantee bandwidth
