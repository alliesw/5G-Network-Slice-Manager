alliesw/Usable-Private-5G-Networks
Network slicing approaches for offering & delivery 5G networks:

(1) Standalone private 5G networks: slicing is used to customize the behavior for different use cases/traffic types and to provide isolation between them.

(2) Virtual private 5G networks: slicing is used to meet customization and isolation needs per use case/traffic type as well as per enterprise customer.

(3) Hybrid private 5G networks: slicing is used to customize and isolate slices per enterprise customer and use case/traffic type. The hybrid approach enables a more flexible distribution of functionality, more efficient use of infrastructure and improved mobility in and out of the customer premises.
Hybrid 5G Networks
- Use Case: Customize and isolate slices per enterprise customer and use case/traffic type at an airport  
- Deployment Methods: Integrating a company's on-premises hardware with the public 5G infrastructure services

Virtual 5G Networks
- Use Case: CV2X - Automated connected-vehicle services (Cellular vehicle-to-everything) to enable communication between vehicles, as well as the public infrasture it's shared with 
- Deployment Methods: On top of an infrastructure layer that is shared with public services

Standalone 5G Networks
- Use Case: solution is deployed or provided as a managed service at a customers premises (airports, etc)
- Deployment Methods: Fully independent & on-premise deployment (independent from the public 5G Infrastructure)  

Different ways of composing private 5G networks (network slices)
Cloud deployment -

RAN

CORE

Transport
- Traffic flows from one network slice (or a group of them) should be mapped into transport resources that match the required Service Level Agreement (SLA) for the slice or group of slices.
